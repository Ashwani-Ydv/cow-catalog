  - Ear tag (required, validated for uniqueness)
  - Sex (required, visual button selector)
  - Pen (required, text input)
  - Status (required, chip selector with Active as default)
  - Weight (optional, numeric validation for positive values)
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Duplicate ear tag detection
- Automatic event creation:
  - Creation event always added
  - Weight check event added if weight provided
- Success confirmation alert
- Cancel and Save buttons

### ✅ CA-04: Cow Detail Screen
**Status**: COMPLETE
- Header card with:
  - Large ear tag display
  - Status badge
  - Sex icon and label
  - Pen information
- Weight statistics card:
  - Current weight display
  - Daily weight gain calculation (from multiple weight checks)
  - Visual trend indicator (up/down/stable arrows)
  - Color-coded status message
- Event timeline:
  - Chronologically sorted (newest first)
  - Color-coded event type dots
  - Event-specific icons
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Formatted timestamps
  - Visual timeline connector between events
- Supported event types:
  - Created (green)
  - Weight check (blue)
  - Treatment (orange)
  - Pen move (purple)
  - Death (red)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
├── Data Layer
│   ├── TypeScript types (Cow, CowEvent, CowStatus, CowSex, CowFilters)
│   ├── AsyncStorage service (CRUD operations)
│   └── React Context (global state management)
│
├── Business Logic
│   ├── Date formatting utilities
│   ├── Weight gain calculations
│   ├── Event description generators
│   └── Filter logic
│
└── UI Layer
    ├── List screen with search/filters
    ├── Add cow form with validation
    ├── Detail screen with timeline
    └── Developer tools screen
```

### Key Features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Persistence**: AsyncStorage for local data
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation with unique ear tag checking
- **Navigation**: Expo Router file-based routing
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode support
- **UX**: Smooth animations, haptic feedback, loading states

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between UI, state, and data
- **Reusable Components**: Themed components for consistency
- **Utility Functions**: Centralized helpers for common operations
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Developer Experience
- Sample data generator (20 cows with realistic events)
- Clear all data functionality
- Statistics display
- No external API dependencies
- Fully offline capable

## Testing the App

1. **Install and Run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Load Sample Data**:
   - Navigate to "Tools" tab
   - Tap "Load Sample Data"
   - Returns to catalog with 20 sample cows

3. **Test Features**:
   - Search for specific ear tags
   - Filter by status and pen
   - Add new cow with validation
   - View cow details with timeline
   - Test dark mode toggle

## Code Quality

✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Clean, readable code
✅ Consistent naming conventions
✅ Comprehensive comments
✅ Error handling throughout
✅ Responsive design
✅ Accessibility considerations

## What's NOT Included (As Per Requirements)

- ❌ User authentication/login
- ❌ Editing existing cows
- ❌ Adding new events to timeline
- ❌ Deleting cows
- ❌ Backend API integration
- ❌ Cloud synchronization

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient FlatList rendering with keyExtractor
- Memoized filter calculations
- Optimized re-renders with React Context
- Lazy loading of detail screens
- Minimal AsyncStorage operations

## Browser/Platform Support

✅ iOS (Simulator and Device)
✅ Android (Emulator and Device)
✅ Web (via Expo web support)
